### Important notes for evaluator

The password is set to "MISIO"

The app shows its best on Chrome. At least one feature is not visible on FF ( input gets blue border on focus)

It does not work with IE by default (applied fallback). Not tested with Opera Mini.

The app contains some elements used before in other apps of mine, so in some places names might seem inconsistent

Finally, there are no tests. I could not get through configuration. In the past, however, I have made some tests. If you read this readme, you can see them in books or tree repos.

TopBar's look differs in YT, depends on whether you logged or not; I had to choose anything
Noone required other elements that TopBar to look like YT, so these do not; i took liberty to give tehm custom look.

Tooltip is added only to mic button

Therea are some other features added that could possibly cover tests
